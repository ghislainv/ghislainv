### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ghislain :blush:

I am an ecologist at Cirad (<https://www.cirad.fr>), a French research center working with developing countries to tackle environmental and development issues. I am conducting research projects in community ecology :seedling: :herb: :evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree: :fallen_leaf:, conservation biology :deciduous_tree: :fire: :bird: :gorilla: :earth_africa:, and applied statistics :pencil2: :straight_ruler: :computer: :chart_with_downwards_trend:.
